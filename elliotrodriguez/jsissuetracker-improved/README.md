"Tutorial" retyped from the GitHub repo by elliotrodriguez, published on March 21, 2019.

## Notes

- An improved version of the [CodingTheSmartWay.com tutorial](https://github.com/seeschweiler/jsissuetracker). elliotrodriguez kept his own README notes on [his repo](https://github.com/elliotrodriguez/jsissuetracker-improved).

- Tutorial uses: Bootstrap, jQuery, ChanceJS library (for UUID generation).

- I tried to only copy & paste if it was a URL or text blob. I basically ignored the tab formatting & left it to VSCode to auto-format.

## Debugging

- Nothing needed debugging! I learned how to use VSCode's inbuilt `diff` tool to find typos, and the JS was already fine.

## Things I Don't Understand (Yet)

- Why do some of the lines *not* end with a semicolon (when I would naively expect all blocks to need semicolons separating their component parts)?

## Lessons Learned

- To use VSCode's quick `diff` of working file with clipboard contents: `Ctrl+K C`. Opens a new tab with clipboard contents in left side of editor, working file in right side of editor, and highlights changes between the two. Also works for partial content (e.g., URLs, shorter snippets of code).
