"Tutorial" retyped from the GitHub repo by elliotrodriguez, published on March 21, 2019.

## Notes

- An improved version of the [CodingTheSmartWay.com tutorial](https://github.com/seeschweiler/jsissuetracker). elliotrodriguez kept his own README notes on [his repo](https://github.com/elliotrodriguez/jsissuetracker-improved).

- Tutorial uses: Bootstrap.

- I tried to only copy & paste if it was a URL or text blob. I basically ignored the tab formatting & left it to VSCode to auto-format.
